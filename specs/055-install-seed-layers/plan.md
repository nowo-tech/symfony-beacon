# Implementation Plan: Install & Seed Layers

**Branch**: `055-install-seed-layers`  
**Date**: 2026-07-21  
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/055-install-seed-layers/spec.md`

## Summary

Split the overloaded `app:seed-demo` into three CLI layers: **platform** (idempotent menus/breadcrumbs for install + upgrade), **demo** (local admin + demo project + `.demo-client.env`), and **sample** (profiled telemetry for QA/load with purge). Update Make targets and operator docs so upgrades run `migrate` + `app:seed-platform` instead of re-running demo seed for navigation.

## Technical Context

| Area | Decision |
|------|----------|
| **Language/Version** | PHP 8.5 / Symfony 8.1 |
| **Primary Dependencies** | Existing seeders (`DashboardMenuDemoSeeder`, `BreadcrumbDemoSeeder`, `AnalyticsDemoSeeder`, `PerformanceDemoSeeder`); Doctrine ORM; Symfony Console |
| **Storage** | MySQL via current entities; **no new tables for MVP** (sample purge scoped to target project telemetry) |
| **Testing** | PHPUnit functional/command tests under `tests/` |
| **Target Platform** | Docker Compose `php` service (`make …`) |
| **Project Type** | Modular Symfony CLI + docs |
| **Performance Goals** | Profile `dev` &lt; 5 minutes on a developer machine; `load`/`huge` batch inserts with `EntityManager::clear()` / flush chunks |
| **Constraints** | Platform seed must never create users/projects/samples; English docs; worker-safe (commands are CLI, not HTTP) |
| **Scale/Scope** | Three commands + Makefile + docs; wizard UI out of scope |

## Constitution Check

| Gate | Status |
|------|--------|
| Spec-first under `specs/` | Pass — `055-install-seed-layers` |
| Prefer nowo-tech kits | Pass — reuses dashboard-menu / breadcrumb kit data via existing seeders |
| English docs / PHPDoc | Pass — README, UPGRADING, CHANGELOG, INSTALL note |
| Docker-first / no host PHP assumption | Pass — `make` + `docker compose exec` |
| Efficient ingest unchanged | Pass — samples written via ORM/services, not Envelope (acceptable for fixtures) |
| Tests required | Pass — FR-010 |

Post-design: no constitution violations.

```

**Structure Decision**: Keep menu/breadcrumb seeders in `Shared`; add platform + sample commands under `Shared\Command`; leave demo identity in `Identity\Command`. Optional later rename `*DemoSeeder` → `*PlatformSeeder` without behavior change (tasks may alias).

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations requiring justification.
